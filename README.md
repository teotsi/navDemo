Java Spring Boot backend that provides navigation instructions using Graphhopper. Designed to work alongside a client 
android app which can be found [here](https://github.com/billk97/Indoor-Tracking-App).

Under `maps` you can find a test map and a python script you can use to test accuracy with random locations all over the map.
