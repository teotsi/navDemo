# NavDemo

Java Spring Boot backend that provides indoor navigation instructions using Graphhopper ðŸ—º. Designed to work alongside a client 
android app which can be found [here](https://github.com/billk97/Indoor-Tracking-App).

# Getting Started

Add your maps under the `resources/maps` directory. `<map-name>.osm` has to exist for Graphhopper to work. The `.geojson` version of the file is only used for the testing frontend. You also need to set said file name to be the one that's used under `application.properties`, for example:
```
spring.mvc.view.prefix= /WEB-INF/jsp/
spring.mvc.view.suffix= .jsp
map.name=nameGoesHereWithoutSuffix
```
The suffixes are added in each method.

# Endpoints

For now the following endpoints have been declared:

`GET /`: provides a simple web-based frontend for testing. Source and destination coordinates (as well as dropdown names) are provided automatically, just make sure your nodes have the `poi=yes` attribute (in case you are using a custom map and not the default one).

`/access-point`: ðŸ“¶ This is a REST endpoint, which means there are `GET` and `POST` endpoints. There's no need for editing or deleting for now. Since this is REST, `GET /access-point/<id>` is also declared. By default there are not APs.
**Example for POST:**  
The url should look like this 
> https://localhost:8080/access-point  

and in the http body add the Json form of an accessPoint Object
~~~json
{
	"ssid":"bil2l",
	"bssid":"1232",
	"level":-34,
	"h":4.5,
	"x":2.0,
	"y":1.2
}
~~~

`/poi`: ðŸš© Similar to the above endpoint, you can `GET` and `POST` specific Points of Interest. By default it is populated with nodes from that have the `poi=yes` tag in the `map.geojson` file.

`nav`: ðŸ§­ The "navigation"  endpoint. You can post source and destination coordinates and receive instructions. the `/` endpoint makes use of this to fetch the instructions.
